DockerEra + CloudEra = Distributed IaaS Like Amazon or Azur
========
Ultra Performant much better then Any Other Cloud Plattform
=========


This Project got Born out of Many Little IDEAS that i got as i Planed to Start my New Internet Service
Now i Ended up and Did my Own IaaS With High Performance Ultra High I/O Blasting Perfromance.


And i Offer that Know How to Anyone Who Needs it.

Docker era mergs the two Old Projects Container Harbor and Varius others into DockerEra Distribution

Goals:
Building a Docker Powered Cloud Plattfrom where you can run Hadoop Tasks in and Store Infinity Data For Processing in Realtime.

Compatiblity to:
Project Atomic DockerHosts
Project CoreOS DockerHosts
Nativ Docker Running Hosts
Linux Windows MAC

Using Ubuntu-Core + JUJU + MAAS + NODE.JS + CloudEra + Serf + Couchbase + Vagrant + Fig + Packer.io + Docker.io and all the Dependencys they got and build on.

## Workflow
# Enter Accounts of Cloud Providers or Baremetals via Conical MAAS
# A Master Controller Installation can Handle the Deployment of the Whole Infrastructure and Scale it Complet
# A Slave is a DockerHost running ubuntu core. 
  - Containers can Choose if Running on HDFS or CouchBase or Local Mounts
  - All Configs and Infos as also data get shared via Couchbase - Long Time Storage via HDFS or Physical Disks
  - Using CloudEra Analyze of Running Processes and Logs.
  - 
# First Test Results The DockerEra Cloud Structure is as Performant as Amazon Cloud or Azure The Diffrents are Realy the Same if you use Windows or Linux as Couchbase Host

DockerEra for Windows is Planed but not focused.




# Ready Services are:
Route53 Clone
S3 Clone
EC2 Clone
More Soon
