=========

Docker era mergs the two Old Projects Container Harbor and Varius others into DockerEra Distribution

Goals:
Building a Docker Powered Cloud Plattfrom where you can run Hadoop Tasks in and Store Infinity Data For Processing in Realtime.

Using Ubuntu-Core + JUJU + MAAS + NODE.JS + CloudEra + Serf + Couchbase + Vagrant + Fig + Packer.io + Docker.io and all the Dependencys they got and build on.

## Workflow
# Enter Accounts of Cloud Providers or Baremetals via Conical MAAS
# A Master Controller Installation can Handle the Deployment of the Whole Infrastructure and Scale it Complet
# A Slave is a DockerHost running ubuntu core. 
  - Containers can Choose if Running on HDFS or CouchBase or Local Mounts
  - All Configs and Infos as also data get shared via Couchbase - Long Time Storage via HDFS or Physical Disks
  - Using CloudEra Analyze of Running Processes and Logs.
  - 
# First Test Results The DockerEra Cloud Structure is as Performant as Amazon Cloud or Azure The Diffrents are Realy the Same if you use Windows or Linux as Couchbase Host

DockerEra for Windows is Planed but not focused.
